# LinguaGraph

Welcome to LinguaGraph, an advanced desktop application designed to aid linguists, literary scholars, and anyone in need of conducting quick and comprehensive linguistic analyses. With LinguaGraph, performing key text analyses on both short and long texts is just a few clicks away.

## Features

- **Text Loading**: Supports .txt files for direct analysis. If you're working with datasets in .csv format, you can use the companion app in the project's Git repository, Dataset Selection, which allows you to choose the column from which to extract the text and save it in .txt format.
- **Word Frequency**: Calculates the frequency of a specific word within the text.
- **Word Frequency by Part-of-Speech (POS)**: Displays the most frequent words divided by their part of speech (e.g., nouns, verbs, adjectives).
- **Concordance**: Finds and displays concordances for a specific word within the text.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Performs sentiment analysis of the text and visualizes the results in a chart.
- **Co-occurrence Network**: Visualizes a network of word co-occurrences within the text.
- **Dispersion Plot**: Illustrates the dispersion of specific words throughout the text.
- **Lexical Diversity**: Measures and displays the lexical diversity of the text corpus.
- **WordCloud**: Generates a WordCloud based on the text.
- **N-grams**: Displays the most common n-grams within the text, with visualization.
- **Readability Score**: Provides the readability index according to Flesch and Flesch-Kincaid parameters.
- **Clean Text**: Prepares your text for analysis by lemmatizing, tokenizing, removing stop-words, and symbols, facilitating the creation of clean datasets for further analysis.
